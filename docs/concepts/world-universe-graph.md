# World Universe Graph

The World Universe Graph (or World Universe View) is the foundational concept behind **World Alchemist**. The World Universe is everything that composes a World from its outter to its inner elements, those elements are what we call **World Systems**. You can think of the World Universe as the architecture that holds all the pieces of your World together, providing a structured and organized way to manage and visualize the various components that make up your fictional universe.

## World Systems

A **World System** is a collection of interconnected elements, known as **World Atom**, that share common characteristics and interact with each other. Since no World is the same, World systems can vary greatly depending on the nature and requirements of the World being created. These systems can encompass various aspects such as geography, culture, economy, politics, magic, technology, and more. Each system is designed to provide its own framework of rules, mechanics and tools that help creators to build particular aspects of their World.

Multiple World Systems can coexist within a single World Universe, allowing creators to develop complex and layered worlds with diverse elements. For example, a World Universe might include separate World Systems for the physical geography of the world, the political structure of its societies, and the magical forces that govern its supernatural phenomena.

Subsystems can also exist within World Systems, providing additional layers of organization and specialization. For instance, within a political World System, there might be subsystems for different forms of government, diplomatic relations, and legal systems.

Creators can choose to implement only the World Systems that are relevant to their World, or even eventually create custom World Systems tailored to their specific needs.

## World Atoms

**World Atom** represents a specific entity or concept within a World System. These atoms are the building blocks that make up the various elements of a World, and they can take many different forms depending on the nature of the World System they belong to. Examples of World Atoms include characters,races, locations, items, events, factions, creatures, and more. Each World Atom is defined by its own set of attributes, properties, and relationships with other atoms within the same World System.
